# [NAME]

## Inspiration ✨

We all enjoy watching movies from a comfy spot with pillows, snacks and blankets. But...those ads at the at the climax of an epic scene? Not so enjoyable. You had to get up, stumble through your snack setup, pillows, get to your laptop and skip the ad. Enter [NAME], a desktop application that allows us to execute commands with nothing but a few gestures of your palm - almost like it's straight out of a Harry Potter movie.

## Demo ✋

Do you want to:

- play/pause a YouTube video,
- scroll pages,
- adjust the volume,
- move the mouse and click,
- or send a message without even having to touch your laptop?

If you said yes to any of these (which you obviously did because we all do these things, duh), then [NAME] has got you covered.

Here's a quick how-to-guide 🙂
