# Wizard.ly

## Inspiration ‚ú®

We all enjoy watching movies from a comfy spot with pillows, snacks and blankets. But...those ads at the at the climax of an epic scene? Not so enjoyable. You had to get up, stumble through your snack setup, pillows, get to your laptop and skip the ad. Enter Wizard.ly, a desktop application that allows us to execute commands with nothing but a few gestures of your palm - almost like it's straight out of a Harry Potter movie.

## Demo ‚úã

Do you want to:

- play/pause a YouTube video,
- scroll pages,
- adjust the volume,
- move the mouse and click,
- or even send a message using your voice?

If you said yes to any of these, then Wizard.ly has got you covered.

Here's a quick how-to-guide üôÇ

<!-- How to use each gesture + gif -->

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

The core of the project is built using:

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Numpy

Other libraries used to enhance functionality include:

- [SpeechDetector](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [pycaw](https://pypi.org/project/pycaw/)
- [keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/)
- [mouse](https://pypi.org/project/mouse/)
- [screeninfo](https://pypi.org/project/screeninfo/)

## Accomplishments üí™

I'm glad to have used my OpenCV knowledge to build a tool that I can see myself using regularly. If you do check out my code, you will find that my method for scrolling pages a bit cheeky üòÅ - I was very excited when that worked out. Also, having developed a module for hand tracking using OOP principles, it will enable me to work on future projects more efficiently. Lastly, I find it amazing that we can achieve wizardly powers with the power of Computer Vision, and it compells me to dive deeper!

Lastly, if you've read this far, I'd like to leave you with my favorite GIF from Kung Fu Panda that shows the power of the Wuxi Finger Hold - a simple hand gesture..._skadoosh_!
